										<h1>Code of conduct</h1>
									</header>

									<p>In a strongly male-dominated field such as ours, we believe that a <strong>clear anti-harassment policy</strong> is necessary so that everyone can fully participate and benefit from this conference. <strong>We do not tolerate harassment in any form</strong>. </p>

									<p>To report a problem or get help, email <strong>care.math.conference[at]gmail.com</strong>, talk directly to one of the organisers, or submit an anonymous complaint here. For full details read below.</p>

									<h3>This code of conduct applies to:</h3>

									<ul>
										<li>all conference activities, including talks, debates, question periods, informal discussions, and social events</li>
										<li>speakers, session chairs, attendees, and organisers</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>What is harassment?</h3>

									<p>According to German law, <strong>harassment</strong> is defined by repeated acts or behaviors that result in a degradation of the living conditions of a person. It results in a deterioration of the physical or mental health of the victim. It can result from non repeating acts of different individuals that either coordinate their actions or are aware that the victim has already been the target of such behavior. For harassment to occur it is not necessary for the perpetrator to have the intention of causing a degradation in the living condition of the person they are harassing. It suffices that the perpetrator’s behavior resulted in the degradation without the perpetrator noticing it.</p>

									<p>Sexual harassment is defined by repeated acts or conduct with a sexual connotation that either violates the dignity of the employee because of its degrading or humiliating nature or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive situation against him/her. It also includes the act of exerting any form of serious pressure, even if not repeated, for the real or apparent purpose of obtaining an act of a sexual nature, whether it is sought for the benefit of the perpetrator or for the benefit of a third party.</p>

									<p><strong>More concretely harassment includes (but is not limited to)</strong>: unwelcome sexual attention; sexualized language or imagery; discriminatory slurs or insults; sustained disruption of talks or events; intimidation, stalking, or following; harassing photography or recording; unwanted physical contact; and persistent, unwanted direct approaches.</p>

									<h3>How to act?</h3>

									<p>We expect everyone to treat one another with equal respect: listen, ask concise questions, and avoid condescending or dismissive behaviours (for example, explaining something in a patronising way to someone who is already knowledgeable). Please use each person’s chosen name and pronouns; do not assume gender. If you are unsure, politely ask or use neutral language (for example, “they/them”). <strong>If someone asks you to stop a particular behaviour, please do so immediately.</strong></p>

									<p>If you are being <strong>harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed</strong>, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.</p>

									<ul>
										<li>
											Personal report: email [care.math.conference[at]gmail.com] or talk to one of the organisers. Reports will be handled confidentially and shared only with those who need the information to investigate and resolve the issue; you will not be required to confront anyone;
										</li>
										<li>
											Anonymous report: submit <a href="">here</a>. We cannot follow up individually on anonymous reports, but we will investigate and take reasonable steps to prevent recurrence.
										</li>
									</ul>

									<p>If a participant violates this policy, organisers may take proportionate action to keep the conference welcoming for everyone. Possible responses include a private warning, asking the person to leave a session, temporary exclusion from events, or removal from the conference. Organisers may also involve venue security or local authorities when appropriate.</p>
